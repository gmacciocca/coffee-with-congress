You should urge your colleagues on the Senate Budget Committee to block these efforts from ever reaching a vote as well.\r\n\r\nGutting the budget of the ACA without proposing an alternative solution is irresponsible.  Over 22 million Americans rely on the ACA because they have no other affordable means for coverage.  The employer coverage model is not enough for all of America.  Aside from choking Medicaid, not funding the ACA means the premium subsidies currently available to lower-income participants will disappear.  And if the mandate to sign up for an insurance plan goes away, then the number of people purchasing individual policies on the exchanges will plummet. Since insurers must decide on their participation for 2018 in the next few months, the number of insurers will also drop.

They do not have the luxury of waiting around while Congress figures out what it wants to propose.\r\n\r\nPresident Obama was chastised for not building enough consensus on both sides of the aisle to pass the ACA.

While he is rapidly divesting his investments to avoid financial scrutiny, he still has stake in ArcelorMittal, one of the biggest producers of steel in the world.  This makes it impossible for him to act impartially in the upcoming Commerce department investigations of the unfair pricing of steel imports from parts of Europe.  \r\n\r\nHis reputation as a vulture investor is well documented, but his purchase of American Home Mortgage Servicing Inc. (AMHSI, now owned by Ocwen) shows how he will not serve the best interests of the American public.  As reported in The Nation on November 30, 2016, Ross bought out the rights to manage day-to-day AMHSI’s operations in August 2007 to control the process of modifying or foreclosing mortgages on over $130B in loans.  The company then outsourced the operations to ﻿DocX, which forged millions of mortgage assignments. In 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fined Ocwen $2.1 billion for “systematic misconduct at every stage of the mortgage process”.  The CEO of DocX went to prison for 5 years for mortgage fraud.  While Ross ultimately left the Ocwen board, he sold $72 million in stock just before it dropped 20 percent in price and is the subject of a civil lawsuit.\r\n\r\nOur country’s core values are non-negotiable, regardless of who is president.  On behalf of all your constituents who value fair trade and a global economy, I ask that you refuse to confirm Wilbur Ross for Secretary of Commerce.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n[NAME_OF_USER]','2018-01-10 03:07:48.000000',NULL,20,52,'federal'),(842,'Dear Representative [NAME_OF_REPRESENTATIVE],\r\n\r\nI am writing to ask that you block Trump’s potential plans for immigration reform.  Trump claims he wants to focus on ‘criminal, illegal immigrants’.  First, nothing prevents law enforcement from reporting illegal immigrants right now. Second, under Trump’s policies, a crime could be border-crossing itself, thus permitting Trump authorization to deport a record number of immigrants who simply came here to build a better life.  Last, he’s built a false narrative around immigrants, using them as scapegoats for the economic hardships of other Americans.\r\n\r\nTrump has repeatedly stated he wants to build a wall on the Mexican-American border.  Aside from the physical impracticality and enormous cost to American taxpayers, this wall contradicts American values already etched on the Statue of Liberty. Trump’s own pick for Secretary of Homeland Security, John Kelly, does not believe a wall will solve illegal immigration problems and calls for more nuanced, layered approaches to address this matter.\r\n\r\nTrump also wants to end sanctuary cities.  We currently have 300 sanctuary cities that recognize coming to this country is not a crime to be met with being held for capture and deportation.  Policies should focus on paths to naturalization instead of deportation, as the mayors of Chicago, San Francisco and New York have already established.\r\n\r\nLast, I ask you to reconsider the DREAM Act.
