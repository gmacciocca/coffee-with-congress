        We are not a business, nonprofit or school.  We are simply of a group of people who want to help American citizens protect freedom, so we started this project.  We are scattered across the globe and believe we are citizens of the world who must help one another.  Some members did not feel comfortable being publicly listed for fear of retaliation.  Our project nor its views do not represent our employers.
